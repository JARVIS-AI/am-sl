## Bio

**Hello**, I don't know why you are here and read or see my CV or portofilo. But here you are. My personal information that I have share with my friends, master, teachers and who is magical girl in my life. (Her name is **Yeganeh_KH**)

As you know site hosted on GitHub so its fast and cool. You can explore my projects in my GitHub account. There is a big note I have to say : I started in a few days these stuff and dev things before that I playing games and working for myself as a freelancer and yep it was good, I was studying high school and now I'm in 3rd term of university.

I'm planing to change my living place to another and I have a few work to do for this decision. I'm little busy for this and other works that I'm doing now (Dev & Programming things Maybe GEEK things).

Beside all of that I'm playing games in free times and never left this action :)

I love my work and life and not married yet, but this is not that I want to say, I means Working as a programmer or developer and seeking new techs or fixing Linux problems, solving math problems or ACM ICPC problems, speaking with geeks and learn new things, learning new language like Chinese, Japanese, French, Spanish or others - spending time in mount climbing, car racing, watching films and playing games in Play Station or PC, reading novels specially Romance, Mysterious, Police and Adventure - reading comics DC - Marvel - Dark horse and others absolutely - playing chess and old games like SEGA and Atari or desk games like chess and snake with ladder.

Reading or studying science articles and videos with no limitation. means If I have interested in a video so nothing can stop me till I finished it.

I have a bike not motor. sometimes I take it out and go out with it till dawn. After that I'm really tired and goto bed like a turtle.
Sometimes I watching other streaming games of players on Twitch and be sure that I can say some of them are really a big player with powerful potential.
One more things, A magical girl that I've mentioned is one of them that I love her no more or less.

> There is a lot of things to talk about but no time and no space on the git

So I think write a novel of myself , hehehe. =)

Be sure to have a good time and enjoy your browsing on the net in my site.
